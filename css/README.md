# CSS Folder

This folder contains **CSS files** that correspond to HTML files present in the `html/` folder.

## ðŸŽ¯ Folder Purpose
For every HTML file, you can create a CSS file that styles it.  
This helps maintain structure and consistency across contributions.

## ðŸ“‚ Example Structure
css/
â”œâ”€â”€ grid-example.css

## ðŸ§© Contribution Guidelines
1. Ensure the CSS file name **matches** its corresponding HTML file name.
2. Follow clean coding practices â€” use meaningful class names.
3. Add comments in your CSS code explaining key styling sections.
4. You can also contribute:
   - Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, forms)
   - Utility classes (margins, paddings, colors)
   - Themed layouts or animations
5. Keep your code readable and responsive when possible.
