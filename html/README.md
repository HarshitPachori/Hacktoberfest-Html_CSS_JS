# HTML Folder

This folder is dedicated to **HTML-related files**.  
Contributors can add examples, templates, and mini-projects related to **HTML fundamentals and layouts**.

## 🧱 Folder Purpose
Here, you can include HTML files that demonstrate:
- Basic structure of an HTML document
- Forms, inputs, and buttons
- Tables and lists
- Semantic HTML (header, footer, main, etc.)
- Flexbox and Grid layout examples
- Bento Grid layouts
- Responsive design examples

## 🧩 Folder Structure
Each file should clearly represent its concept.  
For example:
html/
│
├── table.html
├── flexbox-layout.html
├── grid-example.html
└── bento-grid.html

## 🛠️ Contribution Guidelines
1. Name files meaningfully (e.g., `login-form.html`, `profile-grid.html`).
2. Add a comment at the top of your file describing what it demonstrates.
3. If a related CSS or JS file is needed, create them in the respective `css/` and `js/` folders with the same base name.
4. Update the main README and Contributor.md with your details.
